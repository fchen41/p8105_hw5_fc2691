## Problem 1

library(dplyr)

url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv"

homi_data <- read_csv(url(url), na = c("", "Unknown"))
```
There are total `r ncol(homi_data)` variables and `r nrow(homi_data)` observations in this raw file. It describes each incidents in details with the time, location, the offenders' personal information and the arrest results.  

```{r message = FALSE}

homi_joint_count = left_join(homi_city_count, homi_unsol_count, by = "city_state")
kable(homi_joint_count)

# Focus on Baltimore, MD

  ) %>%

## Problem 2
```{r}
# # Data frame containing all files names. 
# data_path <- "data"
# file_list = list.files(data_path) %>%
#   data.frame()
# 
# purrr::map()
```

## Problem 3
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

set.seed(10)

iris_with_missing = iris %>% 
  map_df(~replace(.x, sample(1:150, 20), NA)) %>%
  mutate(Species = as.character(Species))
